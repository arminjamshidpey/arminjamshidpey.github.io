      <p>Currently I am a Post-doc in department of computer science at University of Waterloo. I work under supervision of <a href = "https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~mwg/">Mark Giesbrecht</a>, <a href = "https://djao.math.uwaterloo.ca/">David Jao</a>, <a href = "https://faculty.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/mmosca/">Michele Mosca</a> and 
      	<a href= "https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~eschost/">Éric Schost</a>. </p>
      <br>
      <p>I got my PhD in mathematics from Western University under joint supervision of <a href="http://gdenham.math.uwo.ca/nlemire/">Nicole Lemire</a> (department of mathematics, Western University) and 
      	<a href= "https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~eschost/">Éric Schost</a> (department of computer science, University of Waterloo) in Aug 2017. For the last two years of my PhD studies, I was a visiting PhD student in department of computer science at University of Waterloo. I was also a visiting PhD student at Fields institute (University of Toronto) in Fall 2015. </p>
